# Weather Recommendation Program

This Python script (`weather_advice.py`) prompts the user to enter the current weather condition (sunny, rainy, or cold) and provides clothing recommendations accordingly. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) in Python to guide program execution based on user input.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python3 weather_advice.py
